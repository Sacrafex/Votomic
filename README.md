# Votomic
An advanced simulation of Atomic Assemblies which interact based on user-set constants including Mass, Viscosity, Friction, and many other things.

Note for Later: Instead of implementing a movement particle, have the shooter physics make the assembly move backwards in the opposite direction due to the shot.
